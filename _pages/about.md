I am a master’s student at the `University of Edinburgh`, exploring the fundamentals of `Natural Language Processing`, `Speech Modelling`, and `Machine Learning`. Outside of class, I am taking on projects and professional courses on the practical applications of `GenAI`, with some of the most exciting areas being `Retrieval-Augmented Generation`, `Vision LLMs`, and automating workflows with `AI Agents`.

Before this, I graduated with Honors in `Computer Science and Engineering` from `PES University`, specializing in `Machine Intelligence` and `Data Science`. My undergraduate thesis focused on 'Generative AI for Virtual Diagnostic Training in Medical Education', where I developed a virtual patient simulation prototype using `Virtual Reality (VR)` and `GenAI` to help early-stage medical students get hands-on diagnostic experience.

I’ve been fortunate to work on some thrilling projects during my internships and roles, leveraging AI across a range of domains—from predicting stock market trends in `finance` to developing assistive learning technologies in `medicine`, and even automating document workflows in `banking`. It’s been amazing to see how AI can applied in so many different challenges and make a real difference in each one!

But life isn’t all about breaking your head over why the loss won’t converge. I’m also a sucker for `video games`, `anime`, and `trekking`—because who doesn’t love the view from the top? I’m currently looking for research or developer roles in `Applied ML` and `GenAI` starting September 2025. End goal: work in deep tech at the frontier, contributing to the development of the latest models! But hey, that’s still a long way off.

If you’re into GenAI, collaboration opportunities, or just want to swap anime recommendations, let’s connect! :sparkles:

(Psst... still working on building my profile!)
