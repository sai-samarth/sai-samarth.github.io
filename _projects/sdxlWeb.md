This repository contains an application built with Streamlit and PyTorch that leverages the Stable Diffusion XL models for Text-to-Image and Image-to-Image generation tasks. The application allows you to use two types of pre-trained models, Text-to-Image and Image-to-Image, to generate images from text prompts or transform input images based on text prompts.
