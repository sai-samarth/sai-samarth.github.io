In this project, I developed an automated music mood recognition system to classify songs into various human emotions based on audio and metadata. Utilizing Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs) extracted from Mel spectrograms, along with Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) and Fast Fourier Transform (FFT), I trained a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model to accurately predict the mood of a song. This system aims to enhance music discovery by automatically assigning mood labels, eliminating the need for manual playlist categorization.

Included in the project repo are PDF and PPT files for a more descriptive analysis of the project.
