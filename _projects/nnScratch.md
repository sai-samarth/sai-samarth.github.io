In this project, I built a basic feedforward neural network from scratch using only Numpy and Pandas to classify handwritten digits (0-9) from the MNIST dataset. This implementation demonstrates the fundamental workings of neural networks without relying on high-level libraries like TensorFlow or PyTorch. The model includes multiple hidden layers with ReLU activations, a softmax output layer, and uses Xavier initialization. It covers data loading, preprocessing, forward and backward propagation, parameter updates, and prediction. Additionally, the project includes visualization of results using Matplotlib, providing a foundational example for understanding neural networks at a more fundamental level.
