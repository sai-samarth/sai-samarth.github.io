In this project, I worked on making [DragGAN](https://github.com/XingangPan/DragGAN) accessible for custom images. I created a repository that provides a step-by-step guide on how to apply DragGAN to your own photos. By using the PTI_Custom_Image notebook in a GPU-enabled Colab session, you can upload your image, generate the necessary .pkl and .pt files, and integrate them into your DragGAN setup. This allows you to interactively manipulate your images using the DragGAN application on both Linux and Windows. I aimed to simplify the process so others can easily experiment with image transformations. Check out the project on GitHub.
