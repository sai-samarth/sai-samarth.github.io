During the COVID-19 pandemic, I developed a face mask detection system to help enhance public health safety. Using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) with the Keras library, I built a model that can accurately determine whether someone is wearing a mask. I trained and tested the model on a diverse dataset from Kaggle, which includes images of individuals with and without face masks. This project allowed me to apply deep learning techniques to a real-world problem.
