In this project, I developed **AutoTimeSeries Predictor**, a web-based application built with Streamlit and Python. The application provides tools for conducting Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), fetching live stock data, and performing time series predictions on uploaded or fetched datasets. Users can upload CSV files or fetch live stock data by entering a stock symbol, visualize data trends, and generate forecasts for future values using a simple and intuitive interface.

**Features:**

- **Upload:** Upload datasets in CSV format or fetch live stock data using stock symbols. Data is displayed in a tabular format for easy viewing.
- **Analytics:** Perform automated EDA on your dataset, visualize specific numeric columns over time, and generate comprehensive reports using YData's Profiling package.
- **Predict:** Conduct time series forecasting on selected numeric columns, define the number of days to forecast, and view predictions in both table and line graph formats.
