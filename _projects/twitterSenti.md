In this project, I developed a Twitter comment sentiment classification system to categorize comments into Hate or Non-Hate. I utilized GloVe for word vectors and implemented a simple LSTM architecture to achieve accurate classifications. The dataset used for this task was sourced from [Twitter Sentiment Analysis](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arkhoshghalb/twitter-sentiment-analysis-hatred-speech).
