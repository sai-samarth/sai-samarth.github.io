This project was created for an introductory Kaggle competition to explore the use of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for classifying handwritten digits. Using the MNIST dataset, I implemented a basic CNN architecture with TensorFlow/Keras to train on 42,000 labeled images and make predictions on 28,000 test images. The model focuses on extracting features through convolutional layers and performing classification with dense layers, providing a solid foundation in data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
