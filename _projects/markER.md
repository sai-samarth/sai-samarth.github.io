Drawing Entity-Relation (ER) diagrams is a very time-consuming and tedious task that often hampers industrial companies designing their databases for the first time. markER eliminates the need for manually drawing diagrams by automatically generating ER diagrams based on user specifications.

The project features a frontend built with React/NextJs, including a coding window for Go language and an output window displaying the ER diagram. The backend, developed in Go, uses a lexical parser to convert code lines into tokens and provides a REST API for seamless interaction.
